# AI-Product-Manager-Colab-Exercises
This repository contains a collection of Colab notebooks completed as part of the AI Product Manager course led by Marily Nika. These exercises focus on applying AI and machine learning, deep learning concepts to real-world product management scenarios. Each notebook includes hands-on tasks covering topics such as data analysis, model building, natural language processing, and AI-driven product strategies.
AI Product Manager Role
Overview
The role of an AI Product Manager (AI PM) is a hybrid position combining skills from both product management and artificial intelligence. AI PMs focus on developing, managing, and launching AI-powered products, ensuring that AI technologies are properly integrated into solving real-world business problems.

As the bridge between technical and non-technical teams, AI PMs ensure that AI technologies deliver maximum business impact while aligning with user needs and business goals.

Core Responsibilities
1. Identifying AI Opportunities
Understanding business problems: AI PMs must deeply understand the business challenges that can be addressed using AI, and identify areas where AI-driven solutions will create the most value.
AI market awareness: AI PMs stay up-to-date with AI advancements and emerging technologies to spot potential opportunities for innovation within the company or for clients.
2. Cross-functional Collaboration
Work with data scientists and engineers: AI PMs collaborate with data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers to understand the technical constraints and capabilities of AI technologies.
Align stakeholders: Ensure alignment across various departments—engineering, design, marketing, sales, and customer success—on the vision and strategy of AI products.
Translate between teams: AI PMs act as translators between highly technical teams (engineering, data science) and non-technical teams (marketing, business) to maintain a clear product vision.
3. Product Strategy and Roadmap
Define the AI product vision: AI PMs develop a clear and comprehensive product vision, which may involve creating PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) and PRFAQs (Press Release and FAQ) that outline how AI will be used to solve specific problems.
Develop the product roadmap: AI PMs ensure that product development is strategically planned, setting priorities and deadlines to deliver AI features on time and within budget.
Lifecycle management: AI PMs oversee the entire lifecycle of AI products, from ideation to development to release, and continuously gather feedback to iterate on future improvements.
4. Ethics and Risk Management
AI ethics: AI PMs consider the ethical implications of AI systems, such as potential biases, transparency, and fairness in the model's decision-making process.
Risk management: AI PMs are responsible for assessing risks associated with AI, including model performance, legal compliance, and user safety.
5. AI Product Evaluation
Data-driven decision making: AI PMs use metrics and KPIs to evaluate the success of AI products. This includes evaluating model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and ensuring it meets the needs of the users.
Continuous iteration: They continuously improve AI models based on feedback, performance data, and technological advances, driving the evolution of AI products over time.
